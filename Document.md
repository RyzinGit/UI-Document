# User Management Screen Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications for the user management screen intended for use by administrators to manage user accounts. The user management screen is split into two main sections: the user list section and the user details section.

## User List Section

### Features:
- **New User Button**: When clicked, clears the user detail form for the entry of a new user.
- **Hide Disabled User Checkbox**: When checked, filters out disabled users from the user list.

### User List Table:
- **Columns**: 
  - ID: Displays the unique identifier for each user.
  - User Name: Displays the username for each user.
  - Email: Displays the user's email address.
  - Enabled: A toggle indicating whether the user's account is enabled or disabled.
  
### Behavior:
- On initial load, the user list is populated with all users.
- Clicking on a user row populates the user detail form with that user's information.
- The list includes a pagination feature if the number of users exceeds the page limit.

## User Details Section

### Fields:
- **Username**: A field for the user's username. Required.

- **Enabled**: A checkbox to enable or disable the user's account. 

### Actions:
